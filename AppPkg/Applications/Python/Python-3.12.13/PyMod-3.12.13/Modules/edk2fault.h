/* edk2fault.h — turning a recovered CPU fault into a Python exception.
 *
 * The guarded accesses themselves live in efi/src/edk2excep.c and contain no
 * Python at all. This is the other half: the one place that knows what a
 * FaultError instance looks like, so that uefi.mem_read and the edk2 module's
 * memory APIs raise the same thing with the same attributes rather than two
 * near-identical exceptions that drift.
 *
 * It is defined in posixmodule.c rather than in edk2module.c, and that is not
 * arbitrary. MIN builds compile posixmodule.c and do NOT compile edk2module.c,
 * but MIN still has uefi.mem_read and so still needs this function; putting it
 * the other way round would leave MIN with an unresolved symbol. The dependency
 * has to point this way for the same reason: `uefi` is the os module and is
 * imported during interpreter startup, so it must not depend on a module that
 * may not be in the image.
